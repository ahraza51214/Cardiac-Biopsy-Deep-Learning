Abstract
<br>
The utilization of artificial intelligence is becoming widely spread in the healthcare sector. Researchers are trying to solve diagnostic tasks by finding new ways to use algorithms. Especially in the field of histopathology, where whole slide images and annotations made by pathologists are presented as datasets. This study seeks to explore how deep neural networks can assist pathologists in predicting cellular rejection on myocardial biopsies, and thereby improve and ensure the quality of their work. Myocardial biopsy is a diagnostic procedure made on patients who have undergone a heart transplant to check if there is any sign of organ rejection. An approach to deal with large-sized whole slide images containing billions of pixels is demonstrated in this paper, where the large-sized image is generated into smaller tiles (patches) and their corresponding masks (labels). Four experiments are made with two different architectures of deep convolutional neural networks namely ResNet34 and VGG16. The pre-processing of the data, training and evaluation of the models are presented in detail for each experiment. The highest achieved scores of the deep architectures presented in this paper have an accuracy of 77% and an intersection over union score of 60%.
